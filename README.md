## Developing

If you are using VS Code devcontainers open the project folder and run "Re-open
in container", then follow the steps below. To develop outside devcontainers
first install the frontend dependencies with `yarn install`, then:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an
> [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
